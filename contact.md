### **If you are interested in joining the lab**

## Students
Given the interdisciplinary work in the lab, qualified students from a variety of backgrounds (neuroscience, biology, mathematics, physics, computer science, and engineering) are encouraged to apply. The Department of Organismic and Evolutionary Biology provides stipend, full tuition, and benefits to accepted students. Condition for acceptance is that the studentâ€™s interests can be matched with a faculty member. Thus, it is imperative that applicants interested in joining the lab through OEB contact [Bence](olveczky@fas.harvard.edu) prior to submitting their application. Students with a strong interest in neuroscience that have been accepted to other relevant PhD programs (Biophysics, Neuroscience, Engineering, MCB, etc) are also encouraged to apply.

## Postdoctoral Fellows
Post-doc positions are available for motivated applicants with a strong interest in systems neuroscience. Contact [Bence](olveczky@fas.harvard.edu) to inquire.
