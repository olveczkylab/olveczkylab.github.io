### Bio

Lucy is a graduate student in the Neuroscience program, joint with Sam Gershman. She graduated from Rice University in 2018, where she studied cognitive science and applied math. She likes classical music, coffee, running, and writing. She also convinced Bence to let her redesign the lab website (template credit to [Kording Lab](https://kordinglab.com)).

### Research Interests

Lucy is broadly interested in how learning algorithms are implemented in brains and artificial agents. In particular, she's curious as to how the brain robustly controls behavior, yet flexibly adapts and transfers learned knowledge to solve new problems. Currently, she's tackling the problem of how the motor system learns and retains representations of skilled behaviors.
