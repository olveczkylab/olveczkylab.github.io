# Ã–lveczky Lab page


This is repository for Olveczky Lab page.


## Add posts
To add posts, navigate to the `_posts` folder. All posts are ordered by date and are written in [markdown format](https://www.markdowntutorial.com/). It's really easy to learn. You just have to headers before writing: `title`, `description`.

An example:

```
---
title: CAPTURE
description: stuff about CAPTURE that would be useful to the greater neuroscience community
---
```

## How to add posts


- **Directly edit on Github**, you can simply go to `_posts` and click `New file` then put some markdown file e.g. `2016-02-03-post-name.md` and start writing blog post. Github also allows you to preview it so it's nice for people who don't want to clone the repo. 

- **Clone the repository**, kind of the same as directly add post on Github. You just have to clone the repository. Then add new post file, commit and push to the repo.


## New to the lab? Add yourself

You can add yourself to the page in `_people` folder just create file name `<firstname>_<lastname>.md` in the folder. We require few line of header before you start writing your own page. See the following for the header

If you don't have information, just leave it blank. The avatar will bring photo from `images/people` folder and display it on people page. 

For lab position, you can choose position from 4 classes including `postdoc`, `gradstudent`, `visiting`, `others` (so called Honorary members). Position will put you into section that you choose.
