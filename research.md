### Research Overview

We are interested in how complex behaviors, learned and otherwise, are generated by the brain. To study this, we use rats, generalist motor learners with a rich behavioral repertoire capable of mastering a variety of motor and cognitive tasks. To decipher how the underlying neural circuits function, we have developed a unique [experimental infrastructure](/techniques.html), including a fully automated high-throughput training system that can be combined with continuous long-term neural recordings and high-resolution 3D behavioral tracking. We further augment our experimental platform with sophisticated circuit dissection tools (optogenetics, pharmacogenetics etc), and use mathematical models to distill the essence of our findings. In collaboration with DeepMind, we have also developed a virtual rodent - a biomechanically realistic model of a rat that is controlled by an artifical neural network and behaves like a real rat. Our ultimate goal is to deliver mechanistic descriptions of how the mammalian brain controls complex behaviors, and how th eunderlying processes may be compromised in disease, including autism.

Our work is currently funded by grants from NIH and SFARI.
