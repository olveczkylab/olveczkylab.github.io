### Research
We are interested in how motor skills are learned and generated by the brain. To study this, we use rodents, generalist motor learners with the capacity to master a variety of different motor tasks. We have developed a unique experimental infrastructure to address these questions, including a fully automated high-throughput training system for rodents that can be combined with continuous long-term neural and behavioral recordings. We use this together with sophisticated circuit dissection tools (optogenetics, pharmacogenetics etc), as well as functional imaging of targeted neuronal populations, to arrive at a mechanistic description of how the mammalian brain learns and executes motor skills.
