### Research
We are interested in how complex behaviors, learned and otherwise, are generated by the brain. To study this, we use rats, generalist motor learners with a complex behavioral repertoire capable of mastering a variety of different motor and cognitive tasks. To decipher the neural circuit logic undelying complex behaviors we have developed a unique experimental infrastructure, including a fully automated high-throughput training system  that can be combined with continuous long-term neural and high-resolution behavioral recordings. We further augment this experimental platform with sophisticated circuit dissection tools (optogenetics, pharmacogenetics etc), mathematical and machine elarning inspired modeling, with the ultimate goal of delivering mechanistic description of how the mammalian brain  controls complex behaviors. We are also interested in how neuropathologires associated with Autism may affect the circuits and behaviors we study.
