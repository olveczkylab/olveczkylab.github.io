### Research Overview

We are interested in how complex behaviors, learned and otherwise, are generated by the brain. To study this, we use rats, generalist motor learners with a rich behavioral repertoire capable of mastering a variety of different motor and cognitive tasks. To decipher the underlying neural circuit logic we have developed a unique [experimental infrastructure](/techniques.html), including a fully automated high-throughput training system that can be combined with continuous long-term neural and high-resolution behavioral recordings. We further augment our experimental platform with sophisticated circuit dissection tools (optogenetics, pharmacogenetics etc), mathematical models, and machine learning based modeling of motor control. The ultimate goal is to deliver mechanistic descriptions of how the mammalian brain controls complex behaviors. We are also interested in how neuropathologires associated with Autism may affect the circuits and behaviors we study.
